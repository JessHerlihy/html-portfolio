<h2>3 of my all time favourite movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>House on Haunted Hill</h3>
<p>I really liked how lighting and music were used in this movie to build tension.</p>
<h3>The Bat</h3>
<p>I loved the strong female cast in this movie. I also was surprised by the twist at the end when the killer was revealed!</p>
<h3>The Haunting</h3>
<p>One of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Kept me on the edge of my seat all throughout.</p>
